break from within try: block (or multiple try: blocks) does not pop the Try structures from the frame.

=================

Sorting backwards?  (the listing in test_basic.py)

Integer relops broken?  (doesn't seem so)

`global` quit working.

/etc/fstab disabled, because of "disk full" errors from unix os9 command.

add dict::get(key, default)

smart sizes for Frame objects.

the sys.stdin.readline() in BASIC cannot distinguish EOF from empty line.

dirty buffers, to speed up.

divide and modulo.

string format.

expand intern table?  for python eval.

python eval used the wrong "import sys" hack.

need fork shell from python.

BASIC:
* Load and Save
* FOR .. NEXT
* GOSUB .. RETURN
* Strings
* PEEK(Hi,Lo) & POKE HI, LO, BYTE

FIXED:
* `FRAME_SIZE=48` is better than 32, but not correct.
* `Pair` is tiny compared to Tuple, which needs a smart len & cap.
* `LoopAllocRoot` to protect new lists of new objects.
